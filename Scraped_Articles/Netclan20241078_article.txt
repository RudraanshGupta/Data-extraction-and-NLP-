Client BackgroundClient: A leading tech firm in the Middle EastIndustry Type:  SecurityServices: Security servicesOrganization Size: 100+The ProblemTraffic Signals are inefficient because even if there are no cars or no pedestrians on the road it still works on a timer and stops the traffic or pedestrian unnecessarily. Our SolutionWe provide a Computer vision-logic to Manipulate the traffic signal to work such that it turns red only when x number of pedestrians are waiting to cross the signal.Solution ArchitectureYolov7 pose estimation
OpencvDeliverablesThe program Detects Pedestrians and Gives alerts to traffic Signals to turn Red or stay Green.
